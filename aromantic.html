                            one thing i have occasionally stated in various places is that i'm "aromantic until proven otherwise". but, what does that exactly mean?
                            let me break it down:<br><br>

                            for a while, i haven't really experienced anything that i would truly consider "romantic" attraction. i've had experiences that have come close to
                            it, however they do not feel like romantic attraction in the way that others have described romantic attraction to me. therefore, i use the
                            aromantic label, but only because it feels that way due to not having experienced that way.<br><br>
                            if i were to experience something which feels like romantic attraction, then i have been "proven otherwise", and may end up changing the label to
                            a different aromantic one (demi?) or dropping it entirely.<br><br>
                            
                            i felt this was worth clarifying, just in case it gets proven otherwise in the future.
