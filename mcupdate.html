                            if you were linked here, you likely asked chromanyan to port one of her mods to a version it does not yet support.<br><br>

                            to keep things rather simple, porting mods is not an easy task. notably, Forge loves to make breaking changes every version, on top of the breaking changes Minecraft itself loves to
                            make all the time. porting to a new version requires making tons of fixes to account for the new version which only grow more and more the more features a mod adds.<br><br>
                            
                            just as an example, between 1.19.2 and 1.20.1 alone, there are several changes which need to be made, most of which are listed in three separate gists:<br>
                            <a href="https://gist.github.com/ChampionAsh5357/c21724bafbc630da2ed8899fe0c1d226">1.19.2 -> 1.19.3</a><br>
                            <a href="https://gist.github.com/ChampionAsh5357/163a75e87599d19ee6b4b879821953e8">1.19.3 -> 1.19.4</a><br>
                            <a href="https://gist.github.com/ChampionAsh5357/cf818acc53ffea6f4387fe28c2977d56">1.19.4 -> 1.20</a><br><br>

                            since 1.20.2, this is further complicated by NeoForge making its own breaking changes and properly separating itself from Forge. i may end up completely skipping 1.20.x.<br><br>

                            personally, i tend to wait until mojang is done with a version to port to it. since 1.19, it is no longer a guarantee that the optimal version to port to is the latest patch version,
                            therefore i wait to see what versions other mods decide to port to and maintain. if you want a near-guaranteed way to tell what version i will port to next, i tend to choose to port
                            to the same versions that Tinkers Construct is being ported to. at the time of writing this, Tinkers Construct is planned to eventually be ported to 1.19.2, therefore my mods are on
                            that version. it is not yet known if Tinkers Construct will port to 1.20.x or if it will be skipped.<br><br>

                            if that was too long for you to want to bother to read, tl;dr i port to the versions i want to port to, which is typically the versions other mod developers feel are worth porting to.
                            if the version you are asking for is relatively new, i likely do not have enough information to tell if it is worth porting to yet.
