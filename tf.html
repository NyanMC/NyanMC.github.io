                        ...but if you're still here, this page is a story about where my interest in transformation came from. it's actually a bit longer of a story
                        than you might expect. originally i wasn't going to do this, but fuck it, cringe culture's dead anyway. who cares if i have some strange
                        interests?<br>
                        <br>

                        <br>
                        also, i would like to clarify my interest in this is <b>not a sexual one</b> and <b>never will be</b>.<br>
                        <br>
                        anyway, this story starts several years ago...<br><br>

                    <h2>part 1: pokémon mystery dungeon</h2>
                    <p>
                        when i was much younger (for the sake of this, we'll say about 7), i used to go with my mom to one of those stores where you can exchange
                        games for other games (very much like a GameStop, except it wasn't called that). at one point, i had picked up a copy of Pokémon Mystery
                        Dungeon: Blue Rescue Team for my Nintendo DS (those of you familiar with this game may already see where this is going).<br>
                        <br>
                        for those unaware about what this game is, the main thing you need to be aware of is that at the very beginning of the game, you take
                        a "personality quiz" and get assigned a pokémon based on your answers. this pokémon is the protagonist and represents "you".<br>
                        the plot of this game involves the main character waking up in the pokémon world <b>as a pokémon</b>, and <b>recalling being human.</b>
                        this is roughly how much of the plot you need to know to be able to understand the rest of this.<br><br>
                    </p>
                </div>

                        this story premise fascinated me. i really liked it, but i didn't quite know why. for the next few months, i had thought about this game
                        from time to time, and been fascinated by the premise of "being originally human, but not anymore". i'm sure it's nothing, though, right?

                    <h2>part 2: a recurring theme</h2>
                    <p>
                        pokémon mystery dungeon wasn't the only place where i encountered this, either. coincidentally (or maybe not), i had also gotten into
                        the Animorphs book series at the time (surprise surprise), and made it to about 40 books in before growing tired of it. normally, i don't stick
                        to a book series for <b>that</b> long, but it just fascinated me.<br>
                        <br>
                        it seemed this theme was portrayed in media often, yet wasn't talked about very frequently. i would see it in shows and movies, games, and
                        other various fiction, and every time i encountered the theme of transformation in something, it just struck something in me. it was strange.
                        i didn't think much of it at the time (after all, why would i? i wasn't very old at this point and my access to the internet was very limited),
                        however, eventually a certain non-tf related game would come out that would change this for me...

                    <h2>part 3: undertale</h2>
                    <p>
                        yes. you have heard me correctly. the hit game Undertale, by Toby Fox, released in 2015. and it's all because of a silly little yellow talking
                        flower.<br>
                        <br>
                        for those that haven't played undertale, Flowey is the first NPC character you're introduced to, and he is a yellow flower with a face. major
                        spoilers for Undertale here: Flowey is revealed to be Asriel (who is an anthropomorphic "goat" monster), now inside the body of a flower.
                        very similar to the transformation theme, don't you think?<br>
                        <br>
                        this stuck with my 11 year old self <b>way</b> too much, and i actually found
                        myself in some sort of transformation-like roleplay, or something. i don't remember much about it (this was 6 years ago, after all), but that
                        happened. i still look back and cringe at it, and it put me off roleplay for several years.<br>
                        <br>
                        after this, i kind of shelved all of the tf stuff until something strange happened a few years later...

                    <h2>part 4: r/tf_irl</h2>
                    <p>
                        this story has finally reached the year 2023. this involves things that have happened within the past few months at the time of writing this.
                        anyway, the reddit algorithm is magic, or something. i was scrolling my homepage, as i usually do when i'm bored, when suddenly i got
                        recommended a post from a subreddit called r/tf_irl. the post seemed very similar to the topic that interested me all those years ago.<br>
                        <br>
                        i opened the subreddit in an incognito window, and sure enough, every post was like this. apparently this "interest" of mine was in something
                        called "transformation", who would have thought? because i was overly paranoid, and knowing that this kind of thing is fetishized by some
                        people (i didn't want people questioning my asexuality), i made a second reddit account under the name u/AnonymousLuna37 (not so anonymous
                        now, is it?). i then proceeded to view so many posts on the subreddit over the course of the next month or so, from both the "top of all time"
                        and "new" categories, that <b>reddit itself</b> gave up trying to find new posts for me (i would hide posts after looking at them, so that i
                        would always see new posts every time i looked at the account). at some point, i decided to join their discord server, under an account
                        also named Luna37 (so that in a worst case, i could just leave if i had to).<br>
                        <br>
                        surprisingly, the discord server was very friendly, and had a strict policy about keeping NSFW content in NSFW channels. after lurking there
                        for about a month or so, i made the bold decision to join the server <b>with my main account</b>. i did not regret this decision at all.
                        i began to make friends with a few of the server members. at one point, i had even joined a roleplay (for the first time in about
                        <b>6 years</b>!). i am still there to this day. that brings us to present day (at the time of writing this, that is). if anything substantial
                        happens regarding myself and this topic, i'll add it to this page. but for now, that is it.
